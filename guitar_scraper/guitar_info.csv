Epiphone has largely retained the characteristics of its famous American big sister, and the sound that comes from the two humbuckers is clearly reminiscent of the original: a rather soft and full-bodied tone, ideally suited for jazz, but with enough edge so that other styles such as blues and rock still sound great.. As with any good semi-acoustic, the Sheraton also has a bit of a ""woody"" resonance in the sound. This is particularly noticeable with more intricate and delicate playing styles in the clean and low crunch range, due to its rich frequency spectrum and great dynamics.",Epiphone Sheraton-II Pro VS,€615,https://www.thomann.de/ie/epiphone_sheraton_ii_pro_vs.htm

John Lennon played almost exclusively on a Epiphone Casino semi-acoustic from about '65 with the Beatles. Originally, the guitar had the present-day Sunburst finish when in 1967, during the course of the psychedelic fashion heyday, it was completely psyched out, only to be then freed from all colour only one year later. The result was the 'Natural Finish', which can be admired in the film 'Let It Be', and later on in 'Imagine'.. In contrast to most current semi-acoustics, the Casino does not have a sustain block, so the top can resonate much more freely. This makes the Casino more susceptible to feedback, with distorted lead sounds being rather more delicate, and the clean or crunch sounds are unique at that: Fabulous dynamics with a good and proper piece of wood. Simple Beatles sounds are easy (even George Harrison often played a Casino), but also for blues guitarists, the Casino could be their guitar for life!.

Epiphone has largely retained the characteristics of its famous American big sister, and the sound that comes from the two humbuckers is clearly reminiscent of the original: a rather soft and full-bodied tone, ideally suited for jazz, but with enough edge so that other styles such as blues and rock still sound great.. As with any good semi-acoustic, the Sheraton also has a bit of a ""woody"" resonance in the sound. This is particularly noticeable with more intricate and delicate playing styles in the clean and low crunch range, due to its rich frequency spectrum and great dynamics..

For almost 2 decades was the guitar god Eric Clapton seen/heard only with his ""Blackie"" assembled from 3 strats. When he decided to give it a truly deserved retirement, Fender built him a guitar exactly like Blackie, combined with a few extra wishes from the master. Due to the maple neck and the new vintage noiseless pickups, the Clapton Strat sounds very pronounced, which can be enhanced with the well-known TBX tone control; because Eric's sound have gone lately slightly fatter, the guitar has a very effective mid-boost; when it's active, the soloist sings again in a prime Woman Tone.

Semi-acoustic guitars. John Lennon played almost exclusively on a Epiphone Casino semi-acoustic from about '65 with the Beatles. Originally, the guitar had a Sunburst finish when in 1967, during the course of the psychedelic fashion heyday, it was completely psyched out, only to be then freed from all colour only one year later. The result was the present-day ""Natural Finish"", which can be admired in the film ""Let It Be"", and later on in ""Imagine"".. In contrast to most current semi-acoustics, the Casino does not have a sustain block, so the top can resonate much more freely. This makes the casino more susceptible to feedback, with distorted lead sounds being rather more delicate, and the clean or crunch sounds are unique at that: Fabulous dynamics with a good and proper piece of wood! Simple Beatles sounds are easy (even George Harrisson often played on a casino), but also for blues guitarists, the Casino could be their guitar for life!",Epiphone Casino NA,€589,https://www.thomann.de/ie/epiphone_casino_nc.htm

The built-in 10"" speaker sounds highly crisp, and if a bit more wumm is needed, a larger external speaker can be connected. At 4 ohms, the amp delivers 40W, which for many situations is completely sufficient. A 3-band tone control and a second channel are included in case you really want to make some noise. A spring reverb unit gives the sound some additional room and shine, and the headphone output enables you to play in the smallest of rooms without disturbing the neighbours..

John Lennon played almost exclusively on a Epiphone Casino semi-acoustic from about '65 with the Beatles. Originally, the guitar had the present-day Sunburst finish when in 1967, during the course of the psychedelic fashion heyday, it was completely psyched out, only to be then freed from all colour only one year later. The result was the 'Natural Finish', which can be admired in the film 'Let It Be', and later on in 'Imagine'.. In contrast to most current semi-acoustics, the Casino does not have a sustain block, so the top can resonate much more freely. This makes the Casino more susceptible to feedback, with distorted lead sounds being rather more delicate, and the clean or crunch sounds are unique at that: Fabulous dynamics with a good and proper piece of wood. Simple Beatles sounds are easy (even George Harrison often played a Casino), but also for blues guitarists, the Casino could be their guitar for life!",Epiphone Casino VS,€555,https://www.thomann.de/ie/epiphone_casino_vintage_sunburst.htm

Originally, Squier was once the only supplier of wallet-friendly variations of Fender models with their original appearance. They had and still have a very good reputation. Even the profis didn't mind being seen with a Squier. After Fender started to produce cheaper models (made in Mexico) under its own name, Squier now supplies the really low-priced Fender models.. The Affinity is a strat for the entry-level budget, and due to its slightly narrower neck (width at the saddle: 40.6 mm) is particularly suitable for young guitarist beginners and those switching models.. With the maple neck and fretboard, like the prototype she was modelled on, she delivers the fast crisp attack, which in combination with the three single coils, represents the classic 1950s strat sound for many music lovers.",Fender Squier Affinity Strat MN 2TSB,€203,https://www.thomann.de/ie/fender_squier_affinity_strat_mn_2tsb.htm

Originally, Squier was once the only supplier of wallet-friendly variations of Fender models with their original appearance. They had and still have a very good reputation. Even the profis didn't mind being seen with a Squier. After Fender started to produce cheaper models (made in Mexico) under its own name, Squier now supplies the really low-priced Fender models.. The Affinity is a strat for the entry-level budget, and due to its slightly narrower neck (width at the saddle: 40.6 mm) is particularly suitable for young guitarist beginners and those switching models.. With the maple neck and fretboard, like the prototype she was modelled on, she delivers the fast crisp attack, which in combination with the three single coils, represents the classic 1950s strat sound for many music lovers.",Fender Squier Affinity Strat B-Stock,€189,https://www.thomann.de/ie/fender_squier_affinity_stratb_stock_6.htm
